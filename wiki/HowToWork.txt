= How to work? =

Ok, how to work is the first question you can ask me. So I write a page to answer your question :-)

== Introduction ==
[[Image(curriculumSimpleB_3.png, width=200px, align=right)]] Suppose to have a scannered paper form.[[BR]]
What you want is get data form image, and you have to identify useful image.[[BR]][[BR]][[BR]] 

In image_form.png you can see two colored rectangles: 
 * Red rectangles identify a single couple of coordinates and a single data
 * Blue rectangles identify a groups of coordinates, and is usefull to group a multichoose data.
[[Image(example_form.png, width=300px, align=center)]]

[[Image(wiki:WikiStart:shot2-XML Builder.png, width=250px, align=right)]]
To start plugin, just open this image with Gimp, and click on OCR -> XML Builder,[[BR]] 
you should see a new panel in your desktop. [[BR]]

If you need to first grab coordinates of a subImage used to reference, for example if you[[BR]] 
need a preprocessing to rotate and cut external border, you have to select area of sub-image and[[BR]]
then click on "got it" button. You should see top-left coordinate of are just selected. [[BR]]
If you got this are, plugin simply subtract from all coordinates, the new reference origin [[BR]]
point, for example: your image is 640x480, but you need a sub-area that start at (30,35). [[BR]]
If you grab a coordinate at (200, 250), program subtract 30 from 200 and 35 from 250 so store (170, 215)[[BR]]
instead (200, 250). All coordinates references are related to (30, 35) instead of (0,0).[[BR]]
Now you are ready to grab coordinates. The procedure is 
 * "add group" 
   * "add coordinates"
   * "add coordinates"
   * "add coordinates"
   * "close group"
 * "add group"
   * "add coordinates"
   * "add coordinates"
   * "close group"
and so on..Every time "close group" is pressed, coordinates and group are added to model.
You can see here two window to add coordinates and group.[[BR]]
When you enter group of coordinates, you need to add label only if you choose "single multichoose" or[[BR]] 
"multi multichoose" because if you choose "field", the group is composed only by an element and label of 
element is label of group. [[BR]][[BR]]
[[Image(wiki:WikiStart:shot3-addGroup.png)]]    [[Image(wiki:WikiStart:shot3-addGroup2.png)]]    [[Image(wiki:WikiStart:shot4-AddCoord.png)]][[BR]]
When you add coordinates, you close group and can see result added to data model and gui: [[BR]][[BR]]
[[Image(wiki:WikiStart:shot6-XML Builder.png, width=300px)]][[BR]][[BR]]

and this is the output file is something like (I used different images and xml output file :Ã¾):
{{{
#!xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<self.document format="a4">
        <data label="baobab" type="2">
                <choose label="coord1" unit="px">
                        <x1>39</x1>
                        <y1>29</y1>
                        <x2>155</x2>
                        <y2>138</y2>
                </choose>
                <choose label="sda" unit="inc">
                        <x1>16</x1>
                        <y1>147</y1>
                        <x2>125</x2>
                        <y2>203</y2>
                </choose>
        </data>
</document>
}}}
